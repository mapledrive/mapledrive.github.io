But Friday evening, President Trump seemed to say that decision was being reconsidered, tweeting that he would review all conservation facts and issue an update soon with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.Zinke later issued a statement, saying: President Trump and I have talked and both believe that conservation and healthy herds are critical. As a result, in a manner compliant with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, the issuing of permits is being put on hold as the decision is being reviewed.The Washington Post has reported on big-game hunting by the presidents sons.The Fish and Wildlife Service said it had found that allowing trophy imports would help the conservation of elephants in those countries, a finding that allows it to authorize the import of the African elephant under the terms of the Endangered Species Act, which lists the African elephant as threatened.Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve those species </div>;
