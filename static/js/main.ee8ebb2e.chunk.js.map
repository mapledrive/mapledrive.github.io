If possible, it’s great if you can capture a screenshot / picture or video.  Pay attention for dev updates.   ​ CHEATERS As of today over 16,000 cheaters have been identified and banned from the game. Cheaters suck. If you run into one, please try and capture the evidence and let us know here: https://www.easy.ac/en-us/support/apexlegends/contact/report/ Even if you don’t get proof, get their ID and flag it and we can investigate the account. We have heard your feedback about a report feature in the game. I’ll just say that’s a very good idea :) ​ ​ https://i.redd.it/umfahlfmuug21.jpg OUR ONGOING CONVERSATION Your trust is truly important to us. Seriously. We said at launch that we will always strive to be direct, honest, and as transparent as we can with all of you. This is how we’ll be starting to do that:  We’re going to start doing more regular updates like this moving forward. I’ll be making posts daily starting Tuesday next week. Not all of these will be ground breaking or major news but think of it as our way of checking in each day to address what we can. Livestreams! As we speak, a production team is building a rad soundstage and set right here at Respawn. I can’t wait to get it up and running and start putting on shows with the team. We will debut our first developer stream around the launch of Season 1.  With the permission of you all and the mod team, I’d like to have a dedicated spot here where I can provide a list of troubleshooting tips for some issues folks are having.  Couple more things in the works that we'll talk about more in the near future.  ​ I wish I could respond to each and every one of you but it’s physically impossible. For context: I currently have nearly 6K responses and over 50 message requests in my inbox, and that’s just this subreddit. Trust me when I say that myself, and many folks on the team are here reading your posts and it’s been the best feeling seeing our baby out in the wild and taking on a life of its own through you.  ​ Enjoy the weekend, be kind to each other, and have fun!

After indulging in some post-dinner beer and chocolate ice cream, my boyfriend and I (F) decided to have an “oral sex party”. We felt creative and made up a card game that allowed us to test the luck of the draw. ~Card game rules at the bottom~ Each number card drawn would result in that amount of minutes of oral play performed on the partner, and if a face card was drawn, additional special features could be implemented during that turn, such as toys or fingers. Each turn consisted of drawing a card and pleasuring the other orally until the timer was up. Then switch and repeat until we couldn’t take it anymore and would inevitably fuck. Pretty straight forward.</p> <p>A few turns in, I had only drawn low numbers and was itching to give him longer blowjobs as he was drawing high cards and face cards. I had just drawn a 4 which followed his 8 minute King turn, so I was incredibly turned on and really just wanted to pleasure him as he deserved. I was having the time of my life, and he clearly was too, so I went off script and ignored the 4 minute timer. I kept going deeper and deeper until I was feeling him down my throat. Turned on by my own accomplishments of getting him that far back, I kept deepthroating him and when he told me he was going to cum, in my own enthusiastic dick swallowing vigor, I accidentally jammed him back to the feeling I knew there was no return from.

After indulging in some post-dinner beer and chocolate ice cream, my boyfriend and I (F) decided to have an “oral sex party”. We felt creative and made up a card game that allowed us to test the luck of the draw. ~Card game rules at the bottom~ Each number card drawn would result in that amount of minutes of oral play performed on the partner, and if a face card was drawn, additional special features could be implemented during that turn, such as toys or fingers. Each turn consisted of drawing a card and pleasuring the other orally until the timer was up. Then switch and repeat until we couldn’t take it anymore and would inevitably fuck. Pretty straight forward. A few turns in, I had only drawn low numbers and was itching to give him longer blowjobs as he was drawing high cards and face cards. I had just drawn a 4 which followed his 8 minute King turn, so I was incredibly turned on and really just wanted to pleasure him as he deserved. I was having the time of my life, and he clearly was too, so I went off script and ignored the 4 minute timer. I kept going deeper and deeper until I was feeling him down my throat. Turned on by my own accomplishments of getting him that far back, I kept deepthroating him and when he told me he was going to cum, in my own enthusiastic dick swallowing vigor, I accidentally jammed him back to the feeling I knew there was no return from.
